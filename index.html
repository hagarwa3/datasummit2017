I think Gamma International should be held accountable for the actions described in the reference readings because not only did they readily sell FinFisher to governments with a questionable human rights record, they also actively helped their most notorious customers remotely access and monitor the computers and smartphones of opposition activists. [1] Without the technical support from Gamma International, these despotic regimes would not be able to spy on their political opponents to this extent. In addition to Gamma International’s comprehensive administration and support, I think they should be held accountable because they designed and coded FinFisher’s functionality and made it into a sophisticated malware that can hide its presence. It is obvious what the intention was when Gamma International created FinFisher – to make digital intrusion as easy and full-service as any other government technology package [2] and then make a profit from selling it to governments around the world. I think it is absolutely unethical to generate revenue from many other people’s sufferings. The invasive spying from the governments’ intelligence gathering operations severely traumatized the targeted victims physically and emotionally, in some cases led to their imprisonment or eventful fleeing.

Based on Gamma International’s in-depth involvement during the administration of FinFisher, it is hard to believe they weren’t aware of its specific uses. Therefore it hardly seems adequate when Muench says he will “let the export controls authorities act as our ‘moral compass’”. [3] His argument is mostly fallacious because he appealed to authority. He is suggesting that because export controls agencies are in a position of authority, whatever their opinion is on the morality or legality of Gamma International’s conduct is correct without question. He doesn’t need their guidance for he already knew of the offending governments’ misdeeds. He also evaded Gallagher’s inquiries regarding the code of conduct, and falsely analogized FinFisher’s infiltration to tabloid phone hacking. This comparison does not make sense because “the scale is different, the technology is different, and, perhaps most crucially, the potential harms are different.” [4] That’s why I do not find Muench’s responses to Gallagher’s inquiries satisfactory.

As I mentioned above, surveillance tools like FinFisher physically and emotionally traumatized its targeted victims. It hijacked their internet identities and obstructed their day to day life. The targeted men, “wary of endangering their families or other activists in Bahrain … have learned to keep politics out of their conversations and have curtailed their social media activity to varying degrees.” [5] This suggests how wildly FinFisher has affected their lives. I think the spying itself is not novel but the extensiveness of the spying is novel to FinFisher because “Using FinFisher, the Bahraini government effectively undermined the asylum Moosa and his compatriots were granted in the UK — the kind of cautionary tale of corporate-state surveillance that has become increasingly common in recent years.” [6]

I think the policy vacuum and conceptual muddle in the case of Moosa is that FinFisher was created by a British-German software comapny, then sold to Bahraini police, who used it to spy on Bahraini exiles in London. [7] It is hard to determine who should be held accountable because it involved so many parties’ interests. I think one way to solve this problem is to make legislation prohibiting companies from making spy malwares in the first place because it is unethical even though it’s profitable. As computer professionals, we should use our expertise to bring joy instead of misery to users. The action of Gamma International in my opinion brought misery to a lot of people thus it reflects negatively on our industry.
